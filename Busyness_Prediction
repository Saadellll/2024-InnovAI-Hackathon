# Busyness Prediction Using AI

## Overview

This project focuses on **predicting busyness levels in service agencies and branches** using **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**. It is designed to help customers **plan their visits effectively** and improve the operational efficiency of service providers. While the initial test case for this project is CIH Bank’s branch in Skhirat, the solution is scalable and adaptable to various sectors like banks, public services, and other customer-facing institutions.

By analyzing multi-source data, such as historical patterns, weather, and holidays, this solution offers actionable recommendations both for customers and service providers. The project integrates advanced AI techniques to handle complex, multi-dimensional datasets that cannot be processed by traditional, rule-based systems.

## Key Features

- **Prediction**: Forecast busyness levels (i.e., customer density) at different times of the day, accounting for external factors like weather, holidays, and paydays.
- **Optimization**: Provide service providers with actionable recommendations to optimize staffing, reduce wait times, and improve operational efficiency.
- **Localization**: Tailor predictions to specific branches or agencies based on local data, demographic information, and external events.
- **Scalability**: While piloted for CIH Skhirat, the solution can be scaled to other branches, sectors, or locations.

## AI Usage and Necessity

### Why AI?
AI plays a critical role in handling large, varied datasets, including external factors like weather, public holidays, and real-time customer behavior. The model dynamically adjusts predictions based on evolving patterns and external data, which cannot be achieved through manual or rule-based systems.

### What Does the AI Do?
- **Prediction**: AI analyzes the various data sources (e.g., weather conditions, historical customer flow, public events) to predict when service locations are likely to be busiest.
- **Optimization**: Based on the predictions, the model offers recommendations to service providers about optimal staffing levels and resource allocation.
- **Localization**: Each branch or service agency gets tailored predictions based on its unique characteristics, historical patterns, and external data influences.

## Problem Statement

Existing solutions, such as **Google Popular Times**, provide basic insights into crowd sizes but lack the **localization** and **depth** needed to predict busyness levels for specific service locations. Furthermore, many service-specific systems fail to account for **external influences** like weather, holidays, or special events. This project aims to solve these issues by providing more **granular and actionable insights** into customer traffic and optimizing resource allocation.

## Approach

1. **Data Collection and Integration**: Data was collected from various sources such as surveys, weather APIs, historical data, and other public sources like OpenStreetMap (OSM).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The raw data underwent cleaning and feature engineering to handle missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables.
3. **Model Development**: The **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** was used to identify clusters of busyness levels based on the collected data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance was evaluated using metrics like **Silhouette Score**, **Log-Likelihood**, and other clustering evaluation techniques.
5. **Visualization**: The final clustering results were visualized, showing the predicted busyness levels and the GMM components' ellipses.

### Data

The data used in this project comes from various sources:
- **Survey Data**: Collected from the CIH Bank’s Skhirat branch to understand customer flow and behavior.
- **External Data**: Includes weather data (via APIs) and public holidays, which influence customer visits.
- **Historical Patterns**: Past customer density and transaction data that help predict future busyness levels.

### Notebooks

1. **`01_data_preprocessing.ipynb`**: This notebook demonstrates the data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding features, and scaling numerical data.
2. **`02_clustering_analysis.ipynb`**: In this notebook, we train and evaluate the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), visualizing clustering results, AIC/BIC plots, and evaluation metrics like Silhouette Score and Log-Likelihood.

### Python Scripts

- **`data_preprocessing.py`**: Contains functions for handling missing data, encoding categorical features, and normalizing the dataset.
- **`clustering_model.py`**: Implements the Gaussian Mixture Model for clustering, with functionality for fitting the model and visualizing the results.
- **`evaluation.py`**: Contains evaluation methods to assess the performance of the model using metrics like Silhouette Score and Log-Likelihood.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/busyness-prediction.git
   cd busyness-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```
   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Preprocess Data**:
   - You can either run the `01_data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook or the `data_preprocessing.py` script to clean and preprocess the raw data.

4. **Train the Model**:
   - To train the GMM model, use the `02_clustering_analysis.ipynb` notebook or run the `clustering_model.py` script.

5. **Evaluate the Model**:
   - The model's evaluation can be done using the `evaluation.py` script or the notebook.

6. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**:
   - If you want to interact with the notebooks, run:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - This will open Jupyter in your browser where you can open and run the notebooks.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with Real-Time Data**: Incorporating live data feeds (e.g., traffic, social media activity) to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Explore more sophisticated features like transaction types, customer demographic data, or external events like festivals or paydays.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the solution to a cloud platform for real-time predictions and customer-facing interfaces.
- **Broader Application**: Expand the system to include other sectors like public services, health services, and more.
